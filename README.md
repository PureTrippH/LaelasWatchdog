# What is Laela's Watchcat?:
Laelas Watchcat is a security and moderation bot for Discord. Well, I guess its a bot for everything. Laelas Watchdog is supposed to try and solve the problem of having 10+ Discord Bots to do one small feature.

# What does Watchcat have that No Other Bot Has?
- The Tier System: Punishments are no longer based on whatever the mod feels like. Laelas Watchdog has created a system with user can get "tiered" and given a specific punishment. Gone are the days of inconsistent punishments and bad moderation decisions. Now, Each Ban Can Be Fair and Equal for All.
        - Tier Forgiveness: Tiers are Forgiven and punishments completely forgotten by the bot after a certain amount of messages over a specific time (a message every 3 seconds).

- Jeopardy: Laela's Watchcat supports its own Jeopardy Minigame, which will give you prompts from the TV show, and rank you among the rest of your server.

# For People Wanting to Contribute, What Do I Need to Know To Contribute?
        - Just a basic understanding on how both Frontends and Backends communicate. In a couple of versions, the emphasis on querying data and opening ports in the backend will greatly increase. I will admit the code is messy (Dont bully me for that. That is why Im here). Most of this lies in the queries so if you want to get started, optimizing MongoDB Queries is the WAY to go.
