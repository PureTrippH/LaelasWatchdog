# What is Watchcat?:
Watchcat is an "All-In-One" bot for Discord. I guess its a bot for everything. Watchcat is supposed to try and solve the problem of having 10+ Discord Bots to do one small feature and clean up your bot list.

# What Are Bot And Dashboard?
## Well, Its the bot and The Dashboard.
### What does the Dashboard Do?
        - Currently, the Dashboard is a website which I run locally (Not on Github atm until the skeleton is complete). 

### What About the Bot
        - The bot has many commands such as trivia, a revamped ban system, reaction gifs, Random Image Roulette, verification, embeds, and much more.       


# How Can I help?
 ### CLEAN THE CODE! 
  - I mention this a lot, but I am far from the best programmer. Any new perspectives on how to clean stuff up would be greatly appreciated. At the minute, the lowest priority for any cleaning in "embed.js". This file is a mess and needs to be
  patched up a bit to boost performance
  - For the Website, there are some bad styling practices that can be looked at in the components file. Please review if you want to support the project
